**Final Report: Life Expectancy Analysis using WHO Data**

# Research Question

How do life expectancy and mortality rates vary between countries, and how are these factors influenced by economic indicators such as GDP?

# Data Sourcing
The data used in this project comes from the World Health Organization (WHO). The dataset is titled Life Expectancy Data.csv and includes health and economic information for different countries. Key features include:
*
Life Expectancy

Adult Mortality

Infant Deaths

GDP

Population

Schooling

Status (Developed or Developing)*

# Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values by removing or filling them where necessary.

Data Exploration: Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore data trends and calculate averages.

Visualization: Created plots to show distributions, comparisons, and trends.

Grouping: Separated countries into developed and developing groups for better comparison.

Statistical Summary: Calculated averages and differences in life expectancy and mortality rates.

# Analysis Process
The analysis was split into two major parts:

1. Life Expectancy Trends
Calculated the global average life expectancy.

Compared life expectancy between developed and developing countries.

Used histograms and box plots to see how life expectancy values are spread.

2. Mortality Risk Zones
Focused on adult mortality rate and under-5 mortality rate.

Marked countries with very high mortality as being in "risk zones."

Compared these countries with their GDP and development status.

# Key Findings
Life Expectancy
The average global life expectancy is 72 years.

Developed countries usually have life expectancy above 70 years.

Developing countries can have life expectancy as low as 40 years.

The difference between developed and developing countries is about 10 years.

# Mortality Risk
Countries with high adult or child death rates are mostly in the developing group.

These countries also tend to have low GDP and lower average years of schooling.

Some African and South Asian countries fall into the "high-risk" zone.

# Recommendations
Support for Health Systems: Governments and international organizations should invest more in health infrastructure, especially in developing countries.

Education Access: Countries with better education also show better health outcomes. Policies that increase access to education can indirectly improve life expectancy.

Economic Growth: Encouraging stable and inclusive economic development could reduce mortality rates and improve quality of life.

Targeted Aid: Aid should focus on countries in the "risk zone" for mortality to reduce global health inequality.

# Conclusion
This analysis shows that economic and social factors have a big impact on how long people live. Countries with better resources, education, and health systems tend to have higher life expectancy. To improve global health, we need to look beyond medicine and focus on education, economy, and social support.
